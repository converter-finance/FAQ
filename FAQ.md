### Q2. What are the sources of yield from using Converter.Finance?<br/>
The main sources of yield include:
1) Fundamental investment income, for example, adding LP will get a
   transaction fee commission reward;

### Q3. What is the token issued by Converter.Finance? What is the totalissuance?
Converter.Finance's token is $CON. The total supply is 48.8 million. Each
block will produce 2.6 $CON. The production will be reduced by 7% every 30
days. Such reduction will suspend until each block generates 0.26 $CON. All
tokens will be produced with the output of the block.

###Q4. What is the distribution of $Con?
The token distribution rules are as follows: <br/>
• 85% for motivating users to provide liquidity and for the ecological
governance DAO funds; <br/>
• 5% for early investors; <br/>

• and 5% for the long-term development of Converter.Finance. <br/>
For the 85% liquidity incentive and DAO fund part:
1) 6%-12% is used to encourage liquidity mining;
2) The remaining part is used to encourage users to participate in staking and
   yield farming.
   
### Q5. Where does the ecological governance DAO fund come from? How to use?
The DAO funds for ecosystem governance come from the output of liquidity
mining, which is similar to the collection of "mining taxes11. Since the first
reduction in production, 1% of the liquidity mining output is allocated to the
DAO funds. Every time the production is reduced, the percentage will
increase by 1% until it reaches 20%. <br/>
The DAO fund is an important way to realize ecological governance. Users
who hold $CON can participate in the ecological governance of Converter.
The use of DAO funds is initiated by the community and determined by
community voting. It can be used (including but not limited to) to encourage
community developers, provide services for Converter users, and all other
initiatives that are conducive to the development of Converter's ecology.
